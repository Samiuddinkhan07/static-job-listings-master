## My process

The approached i followed was to focus on the rendering the list first then rending the same list again while the user is searching for a specific role,after that my focus was to add the search tag and remove those tags with that i also leaned more mobile first approach so that i can minimize the working time on my media quries

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS

### What I learned

Building this project has taught me many new things, such as event delegation, and has fine-tuned my skills in filtering lists, removing items from arrays, and manipulating arrays. Additionally, I have learned how to craft pixel-perfect details.

### Continued development

For my future projects i really wanna focus on multi-step form and caching the data in case the user closes the website,the technique i really wanna work on is DRY and keep the code clean.
